Oscar nominee Denis Villeneuve (“Arrival,” “Blade Runner 2049”) directs Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures’ “Dune,” the big-screen adaptation of Frank Herbert’s seminal bestseller of the same name.

A mythic and emotionally charged hero’s journey, “Dune” tells the story of Paul Atreides, a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding, who must travel to the most dangerous planet in the universe to ensure the future of his family and his people. As malevolent forces explode into conflict over the planet’s exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existence—a commodity capable of unlocking humanity’s greatest potential—only those who can conquer their fear will survive.

The film stars Oscar nominee Timothée Chalamet (“Call Me by Your Name,” “Little Women”), Rebecca Ferguson (“Stephen King’s Doctor Sleep,” “Mission: Impossible – Fallout”), Oscar Isaac (the “Star Wars” franchise) Oscar nominee Josh Brolin (“Milk,” “Avengers: Infinity War”), Stellan Skarsgård (HBO’s “Chernobyl,” “Avengers: Age of Ultron”), Dave Bautista (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “Avengers: Endgame”), Stephen McKinley Henderson (“Fences,” “Lady Bird”), Zendaya (“Spider-Man: Homecoming,” HBO’s “Euphoria”), Chang Chen (“Mr. Long,” “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon”), David Dastmalchian (“Blade Runner 2049,” “The Dark Knight”), Sharon Duncan-Brewster (“Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,” Netflix’s “Sex Education”), with Oscar nominee Charlotte Rampling (“45 Years,” “Assassin’s Creed”), with Jason Momoa (“Aquaman,” HBO’s “Game of Thrones”), and Oscar winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men,” “Skyfall”).

Villeneuve directed “Dune” from a screenplay by Jon Spaihts and Villeneuve and Eric Roth based on the novel of the same name written by Frank Herbert. Villeneuve also produced the film with Mary Parent, Cale Boyter and Joe Caracciolo, Jr. The executive producers are Tanya Lapointe, Joshua Grode, Herbert W. Gains, Jon Spaihts, Thomas Tull, Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt and Kim Herbert.

Behind the scenes, Villeneuve reteamed with two-time Oscar-nominated production designer Patrice Vermette (“Arrival,” “Sicario,” “The Young Victoria”), two-time Oscar-nominated editor Joe Walker (“Blade Runner 2049,” “Arrival,” “12 Years a Slave”), two-time Oscar-winning visual effects supervisor Paul Lambert (“First Man,” “Blade Runner 2049”), and Oscar-winning special effects supervisor Gerd Nefzer (“Blade Runner 2049”). He also collaborated for the first time with Oscar-nominated director of photography Greig Fraser (“Lion,” “Zero Dark Thirty,” “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story”); three-time Oscar-nominated costume designer Jacqueline West (“The Revenant,” “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” “Quills”) and costume designer Robert Morgan; and stunt coordinator Tom Struthers (“The Dark Knight” trilogy, “Inception”). Oscar-winning and multiple Oscar-nominated composer Hans Zimmer (“Blade Runner 2049,” “Inception,” “Gladiator,” “The Lion King”) is creating the score.

Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures Present a Legendary Pictures Production, a Film by Denis Villeneuve, “Dune.” The film is slated to be released in select theaters in 2D and 3D and IMAX and on HBO Max on October 22, 2021 and will be available on HBO Max’s Ad-Free plan in 4K UHD, HDR10, Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos (English Only) on supported devices for 31 days from theatrical release.

The film has been rated PG-13 for sequences of strong violence, some disturbing images and suggestive material.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8g18jFHCLXk/default.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8g18jFHCLXk/mqdefault.jpg,Warner Bros.

2021-07-22T17:00:05Z,Germany after the flooding | DW Documentary,"Germany is in shock. Days of heavy rain caused several rivers to burst their banks, flooding entire towns and villages. More than 160 people lost their lives. Now survivors are battling to clean up in the wake of the disaster. 

Several European countries have been hit by extreme weather, and many lives have been lost. Regions in western Germany have been most severely affected: in Rhineland-Palatinate, the south of North Rhine-Westphalia, and parts of Bavaria. The floodwaters destroyed highways, houses and whole communities. The floods have receded, leaving behind thick mud and tons of rubble. Chancellor Angela Merkel and other political leaders visited the disaster zones, offering encouragement and promising swift financial help for victims of the flooding. But many of those affected have criticized the emergency response as chaotic. In contrast, communities came together in solidarity – many people travelled long distances to offer their help. DW reporter Miodrag Soric visited the badly hit localities of Schuld and Walporzheim in Rhineland-Palatinate. He reports on how residents and volunteer helpers are dealing with the aftermath of the flooding.

2021-07-22T17:54:27Z,Dead Space Official Teaser Trailer – EA Play Live 2021,"The sci-fi survival horror classic Dead Space returns, completely rebuilt from the ground up by Motive Studios to offer a deeper and more immersive experience. Harnessing the power of the Frostbite game engine and next generation consoles, this remake brings jaw-dropping visual fidelity and improvements to gameplay while staying true to the original. Dead Space will be available on PlayStation®5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Isaac Clarke is an everyman engineer on a mission to repair a vast, sprawling starship, the USG Ishimura, only to discover something has gone horribly wrong. The ship's crew has been slaughtered and infected by some alien scourge...and Isaac’s beloved partner, Nicole, is lost somewhere on board.

Now Isaac is alone with only his tools and engineering skills as he attempts to uncover the nightmarish mystery of what happened aboard the Ishimura. Trapped with hostile creatures called “necromorphs”, Isaac faces a battle for survival, not only against the escalating terrors of the ship, but his own crumbling sanity.

2021-07-21T21:15:12Z,I Played Minecraft With Hank From Breaking Bad,"GET MY HOODIE AT: https://www.quackity.shop/

JESSE! Hank from Breaking Bad is playing Minecraft, this is bad for the operation. Just kidding, it's great because Minecraft is the game Hank from Breaking Bad is playing today along with GeorgeNotFound who is also in the Dream Minecraft Dream Manhunt videos and GeorgeNotFound never wins by the way which is funny, and BadBoyHalo another friend who is also in the Dream Minecraft Manhunt Videos. Hank Breaking Bad AKA Dean Norris is one of the funniest Minecraft players I know, I actually love Hank Breaking Bad and Breaking Bad the show, it is very good. So now that we have Hank Breaking Bad playing Minecraft with me Quackity, GeorgeNotFound, and BadBoyHalo, this is simply the best day of my life.

All jokes aside, Breaking Bad is one of my favorite shows of all time, without a doubt. To be able to have the honor of having Dean Norris play Minecraft with me still doesn't feel real. I'll tell you firsthand he is one of the sweetest kindest guys ever, and even though I put him through this pain of being in this silly video, he was so kind about everything. Dean Norris 4 evr.

Lyrics

Well, I can find my way
I know my left from right
Because we never close
I'm open day and night

I know my way around
I walk towards the light
I'm open 'round the clock
I don't get lost at night

(Chorus)
You never used to be afraid of days like these
But now you're overwhelmed by your anxieties
Let me help you out, let me be your guide
I can help you reach the love you feel inside

Well, I can find my way
I know my left from right
Because wе never close
I'm opеn day and night

(Chorus)
You never used to be afraid of days like these
But now you're overwhelmed by your anxieties
Let me help you out, let me be your guide
I can help you reach the love you feel inside

I know my way around
I walk towards the light
I'm open 'round the clock
I don't get lost at night

But now you're overwhelmed by your anxieties
Let me help you out, let me be your guide
I can help you reach the love you feel inside

2021-07-22T16:00:22Z,Ariana Grande - positions (Official Live Performance) | Vevo,"Ariana Grande - positions (Official Live Performance) | Vevo

If our Official Live Performances of “pov” and “safety net” reveal anything, it’s that Ariana Grande excels at her job because she’s so passionate about the results. You don’t hit the high notes, you don’t exude candor, and you don’t make pop music as moving as she does without crossing the T’s and dotting the I’s. A very cool Cali session with the look and feel of a cozy little meadow was a perfect place to turn some of the best tunes on ‘Positions’ into utterly memorable performances. Go Team Ari. In a typically inventive move, our hero chose to loop her vocals when it came time to perform the album’s title track. Watch her augment the band’s moves with a little layering of her voice. As she references both the kitchen and the bedroom in her lyrics, the sound stacks up, taking on its own internal rhythm. Beautiful.

If our Official Live Performances of “pov” and “safety net” reveal anything, it’s that Ariana Grande excels at her job because she’s so passionate about the results. You don’t hit the high notes, you don’t exude candor, and you don’t make pop music as moving as she does without crossing the T’s and dotting the I’s. A very cool Cali session with the look and feel of a cozy little meadow was a perfect place to turn some of the best tunes on ‘Positions’ into utterly memorable performances. Go Team Ari. In a typically inventive move, our hero chose to loop her vocals when it came time to perform the album’s title track. Watch her augment the band’s moves with a little layering of her voice. As she references both the kitchen and the bedroom in her lyrics, the sound stacks up, taking on its own internal rhythm. Beautiful.

STONED AT THE NAIL SALON (LYRICS )
 
Got a wishbone drying on the windowsill in my kitchen  
Just in case I wake up and realise I’ve chosen wrong  
I love this life that I have  
The vine hanging over the door  
And the dog who comes when I call  
But I wonder sometimes what I’m missing 
 
My hot blood’s been burning for so many summers now 
It’s time to cool it down   
Wherever that leads  
 
‘Cause all the beautiful girls, they will fade like the roses  
And all the times they will change, it’ll all come around 
I don’t know 
Maybe I’m just stoned at the nail salon 
Maybe I’m just stoned at the nail salon again 
 
Got a memory of waiting in your bed wearing only my earrings  
We’d go dancing all over the land mines under our town  
But the sun has to rise  
When it does, we’ll divide up the papers  
Two former hell-raisers  
I’m still crazy for you, babe 
 
My hot blood’s been burning for so many summers now 
It’s time to cool it down   
Wherever that leads  
 
‘Cause all the music you loved at sixteen, you’ll grow out of  
And all the times they will change, it’ll all come around 
I don’t know 
Maybe I’m just stoned at the nail salon 
Maybe I’m just stoned at the nail salon again 
 
Oh, make it good  
Oh, make it good 
I’d ride and I’d ride on the carousel round and round forever if I could  
But it’s time to cool it down  
Whatever that means 
 
Spend all the evenings you can with the people who raised you 
Cause all the times they will change, it’ll all come around 
I don’t know 
Maybe I’m just stoned at the nail salon 
Maybe I’m just stoned at the nail salon again
