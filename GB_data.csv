2021-07-21T21:15:12Z,I Played Minecraft With Hank From Breaking Bad,"GET MY HOODIE AT: https://www.quackity.shop/

JESSE! Hank from Breaking Bad is playing Minecraft, this is bad for the operation. Just kidding, it's great because Minecraft is the game Hank from Breaking Bad is playing today along with GeorgeNotFound who is also in the Dream Minecraft Dream Manhunt videos and GeorgeNotFound never wins by the way which is funny, and BadBoyHalo another friend who is also in the Dream Minecraft Manhunt Videos. Hank Breaking Bad AKA Dean Norris is one of the funniest Minecraft players I know, I actually love Hank Breaking Bad and Breaking Bad the show, it is very good. So now that we have Hank Breaking Bad playing Minecraft with me Quackity, GeorgeNotFound, and BadBoyHalo, this is simply the best day of my life.

All jokes aside, Breaking Bad is one of my favorite shows of all time, without a doubt. To be able to have the honor of having Dean Norris play Minecraft with me still doesn't feel real. I'll tell you firsthand he is one of the sweetest kindest guys ever, and even though I put him through this pain of being in this silly video, he was so kind about everything. Dean Norris 4 evr.

Verstappen & Hamilton collide on Lap 1. A very interesting accident between the championship rivals. Do you think it was a racing incident? Did Verstappen leave enough space, should Hamilton have seen it coming? What is your favorite vegetable? What crash would you like to see next?

Thomas spent 7 days exploring around the countryside of Albania in the search for some of the abandoned bunkers left behind after the the communist dictator Enver Hoxha's brutal rule from the 1940's to the 1980's. Yet what we found after a few days was so much more than we'd originally come for. The nature, the kindness of the people and the rich history blew us away. We still left wondering what the future of these bunkers holds...

STONED AT THE NAIL SALON (LYRICS )
 
Got a wishbone drying on the windowsill in my kitchen  
Just in case I wake up and realise I’ve chosen wrong  
I love this life that I have  
The vine hanging over the door  
And the dog who comes when I call  
But I wonder sometimes what I’m missing 
 
My hot blood’s been burning for so many summers now 
It’s time to cool it down   
Wherever that leads  
 
‘Cause all the beautiful girls, they will fade like the roses  
And all the times they will change, it’ll all come around 
I don’t know 
Maybe I’m just stoned at the nail salon 
Maybe I’m just stoned at the nail salon again 
 
Got a memory of waiting in your bed wearing only my earrings  
We’d go dancing all over the land mines under our town  
But the sun has to rise  
When it does, we’ll divide up the papers  
Two former hell-raisers  
I’m still crazy for you, babe 
 
My hot blood’s been burning for so many summers now 
It’s time to cool it down   
Wherever that leads  
 
‘Cause all the music you loved at sixteen, you’ll grow out of  
And all the times they will change, it’ll all come around 
I don’t know 
Maybe I’m just stoned at the nail salon 
Maybe I’m just stoned at the nail salon again 
 
Oh, make it good  
Oh, make it good 
I’d ride and I’d ride on the carousel round and round forever if I could  
But it’s time to cool it down  
Whatever that means 
 
Spend all the evenings you can with the people who raised you 
Cause all the times they will change, it’ll all come around 
I don’t know 
Maybe I’m just stoned at the nail salon 
Maybe I’m just stoned at the nail salon again

But I wonder sometimes what I’m missing 
 
My hot blood’s been burning for so many summers now 
It’s time to cool it down   
Wherever that leads  
 
‘Cause all the beautiful girls, they will fade like the roses  
And all the times they will change, it’ll all come around 
I don’t know 
Maybe I’m just stoned at the nail salon 
Maybe I’m just stoned at the nail salon again 
 
Got a memory of waiting in your bed wearing only my earrings  
We’d go dancing all over the land mines under our town  
But the sun has to rise  
When it does, we’ll divide up the papers  
Two former hell-raisers  
I’m still crazy for you, babe 
 
My hot blood’s been burning for so many summers now 
It’s time to cool it down   
Wherever that leads  
 
‘Cause all the music you loved at sixteen, you’ll grow out of  
And all the times they will change, it’ll all come around 
I don’t know 
Maybe I’m just stoned at the nail salon 
Maybe I’m just stoned at the nail salon again 
 
Oh, make it good  
Oh, make it good 
I’d ride and I’d ride on the carousel round and round forever if I could  
But it’s time to cool it down  
Whatever that means 
 
Spend all the evenings you can with the people who raised you 
Cause all the times they will change, it’ll all come around 
I don’t know 
Maybe I’m just stoned at the nail salon 
Maybe I’m just stoned at the nail salon again

The Leader of the Opposition, Sir Keir Starmer, asks six questions and the leader of the second largest opposition party asks two.
